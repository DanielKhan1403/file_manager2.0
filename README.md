# File Manager 2.0

Welcome to **File Manager 2.0** – the second version of my File Manager project. In this release, I have completely rewritten the application using **React**, **Vite**, and **Redux Thunk**. Additionally, I’ve fixed several bugs on the backend side to enhance the overall functionality.

## 🚀 Features

### Frontend:
- **Built with React & Vite** for fast and optimized development.
- **State management with Redux** using **Redux Thunk** for efficient handling of asynchronous actions.
- **Enhanced UI/UX** for a more user-friendly experience.

### Backend:
- **Bug fixes and improvements** in the backend to ensure smoother file management operations.
- **Optimized file management logic** for better performance.

## 🌱 Future Plans

- **Database Query Optimization**: I plan to further optimize database queries to improve speed and efficiency.
- **Caching**: Introduce caching to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Extended Functionality**: Additional features are planned, including:
  - Advanced sharing options.
  - File versioning.
  - Enhanced file search functionality.
