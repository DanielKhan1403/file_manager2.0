# Full Stack File Manager Project

This is my first full-stack project, where I built both the backend and frontend. My goal is to develop a user-friendly file manager with private access and public sharing capabilities through links. I plan to enhance and improve this project over time.

## Project Overview

- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: React
- **Key Features**:
  - Private access to files
  - Public links for sharing
  - User authentication and authorization

## Folder Structure

- **serverex/**: Contains the Django backend for file management, including user authentication, file uploads, and permissions.
- **frontend/**: Contains the React frontend for user interaction, file upload/download, and link generation.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- React and npm (for frontend)
- Python and Django (for backend)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanielKhan1403/FirstFullStackProject.git

cd serverex
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
